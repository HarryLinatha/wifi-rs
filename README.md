# WiFi-rs

A rust crate to interface and manage Wi-Fi networks.

This is a command-line counterpart of managing networks instead of via a GUI.

## Features

- Connect to a WiFi (`Windows`, `Linux`, `MacOS`).
- Disconnect from a WiFi network (`Windows`, `Linux`, `MacOS`).
- Create hotspot (`Windows`, `Linux`).

## Currently supported network types

Note that only **open**, **WEP** and **WPA-PSK** networks are supported at the moment.

> It is also supposed that IP configuration is obtained via DHCP.

## Supported Operating Systems

- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS

## Example

```Rust
use wifi_rs::{prelude::*, WiFi};

fn main() -> Result<(), WifiConnectionError> {
    let config = Some(Config {
        interface: Some("wlo1"),
    });

    let mut wifi = WiFi::new(config);

    match wifi.connect("AndroidAPSD22", "belm4235") {
        Ok(result) => println!(
            "{}",
            if result == true {
                "Connection Successful."
            } else {
                "Invalid password."
            }
        ),
        Err(err) => println!("The following error occurred: {:?}", err),
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
